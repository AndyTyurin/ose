# Roadmap
- Make game object is main class for other objects,
  instead of group that aggregates another game object interfaces.
- Uniform, attribute handling is not finished yet,
  we shall bind them when rendering, so each of them
  apply data to GPU.
- GL Context must be used only in Renderer scope.
- To write texture.
- To write particle system. Explain some kinds of particle systems types, for example:
physics bounded particles.
- To find better place for texture bind/unbind interface location.
